    <h2>Hello, my name is Ana!</h2>
    <p>I'm 31 years old (at the time of writing), brazilian, am a Bachelor in Veterinary Medicine (UFRPE), Animal Behavior Specialist (PUC-Minas) and studying the world of Front-End, trying out HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
    <p>I also like to draw (sometimes) and learn all kinds of new stuff!</p>
    <p>I'm using this page to test out the Git-GitHub functionalities. Using this to link and edit my documents in real time seems pretty neat.</p>
